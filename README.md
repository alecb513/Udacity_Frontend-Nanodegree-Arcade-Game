4. NOTE - Files included with the download, located in the: images,js, and css directories are required to play.

**How to Play**

Using the arrow keys on your keyboard move the charator up, down, left, or right.  You're goal is to reach the water while avoiding the bugs.  When you've reached your goal you'll be braught back the the starting point and 1 point, or 'times crossed' will increase by one.  If you choose to keep going simply move up one space and continue your journey.  You're goal is to make it to the water as many times in a row as possible without getting hit by bugs.  If a bug hits you, you start over and your times crossed goes back to zero.  Try to earn as points as possible without getting hit by bugs!!!
